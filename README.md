Password Generator (Python)

A small and simple password generator you can run directly in the terminal.
I built this project while practicing Python basics and taking on a daily coding challenge to improve step by step.

It’s beginner-friendly, easy to understand, and actually useful.

🚀 Features

Choose the password length

Decide what to include:

Letters (uppercase & lowercase)

Numbers

Symbols

Uses only Python built-in libraries

🧠 How It Works

You enter how long you want the password to be

You choose what characters to include

The script randomly generates a password and prints it

Simple, fast, and effective.
